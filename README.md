# ConquadeJS
Nobody remembers why we named it that!
Weird.

ConquadeJS is a framework based on ExpressJS that is virtually ready out of the box to host basic HTML. Its great if you just want to run a personal test server if you want to run your own HTML, pug or any other expressjs-supported language! You can even use your own CSS code all within the views folder

##Out of the box ready

As soon as you download it and either run the SFX archive or you have downloaded the zip file with the conquadejs system in it, you are now free to edit the views folder and run your web server! How cool is that, right? We do most of the work for you.

##Configuration

###Getting Started
How to get started in a few words:

MAKE SURE your system has NodeJS installed as well as NPM (Node Package Manager) and, if it runs lunix, optionally, Chromium Browser because it contains a buffed up JavaScript. Then download the zip file of the actual application to use and unzip it to a directory of your choosing. **Lunix users** run the below after unziping while in the directory one above the one in witch you extracted all the files

     $ sudo chmod 777

Finally, begin editiing the views folder with HTML, CSS and whatever other languages you can choose in the config files below. Once you are happy, run the below command on a terminal opened up **to that directory**

     $ npm start


###Getting Stopped
When you feel like it just press CTRL+C to stop the conquadejs system altogether, or if you are on lunix kill it with the kill command.

###Getting Configured
